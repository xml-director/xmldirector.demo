``xmldirector.plonecore`` is the technical foundation of the XML-Director
project (www.xml-director.info). The goal of the XML-Director project is
building an enterprise-level XML content management system on top of the CMS
Plone (www.plone.org) with support for XML databases like eXis-db or Base-X.
However the underlaying implementation can also be used to mount arbitrary
backend through WebDAV into Plone.
