<line globalnumber="33" number="28">I cannot delve him to the root: his father</line>

<line globalnumber="35" number="30">Against the Romans with Cassibelan,</line>

<line globalnumber="44" number="39">Big of this gentleman, our theme, deceas&#8217;d</line>
<line globalnumber="45" number="40">As he was born. The King he takes the babe</line>
<line globalnumber="46" number="41">To his protection, calls him Posthumus Leonatus,</line>
<line globalnumber="47" number="42">Breeds him and makes him of his bedchamber,</line>
<line globalnumber="48" number="43">Puts to him all the learnings that his time</line>
<line globalnumber="49" number="44">Could make him the receiver of, which he took,</line>
<line globalnumber="50" number="45">As we do air, fast as &#8217;twas minist&#8217;red,</line>

<line globalnumber="53" number="48">A sample to the youngest, to th&#8217; more mature</line>
<line globalnumber="54" number="49">A glass that feated them, and to the graver</line>
<line globalnumber="55" number="50">A child that guided dotards. To his mistress</line>
<line globalnumber="56" number="51">(For whom he now is banish&#8217;d), her own price</line>
<line globalnumber="57" number="52">Proclaims how she esteem&#8217;d him; and his virtue</line>
