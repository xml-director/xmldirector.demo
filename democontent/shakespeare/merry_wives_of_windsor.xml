<line globalnumber="399" number="34">Why, you say well. But I have another messenger to your worship. Mistress Page hath her hearty commendations to you too; and let me tell you in your ear, she&#8217;s as fartuous a civil modest wife, and one (I tell you) that will not miss you morning nor evening prayer, as any is in Windsor, whoe&#8217;er be the other; and she bade me tell your worship that her husband is seldom from home, but she hopes there will come a time.

<line globalnumber="403" number="38">That were a jest indeed! They have not so little grace, I hope. That were a trick indeed! But Mistress Page would desire you to send her your little page, of all loves. Her husband has a marvellous infection to the little page; and truly Master Page is an honest man. Never a wife in Windsor leads a better life than she does: do what she will, say what she will, take all, pay all, go to bed when she list, rise when she list, all is as she will; and truly she deserves it, for if there be a kind woman in Windsor, she is one. You must send her your page, no remedy.</line>

But whatsoever I have merited, either in my mind or in my means, meed I am sure I have receiv&#8217;d none, unless experience be a jewel&#8212;that I have purchas&#8217;d at an infinite rate, and that hath taught me to say this:</line>

Terms! Names! Amaimon sounds well; Lucifer, well; Barbason, well; yet they are devils&#8217; additions, the names of fiends; but Cuckold! Wittol!&#8212;Cuckold! The devil himself hath not such a name. Page is an ass, a secure ass; he will trust his wife, he will not be jealous. I will rather trust a Fleming with my butter, Parson Hugh the Welshman with my cheese, an Irishman with my aqua-vitae bottle, or a thief to walk my ambling gelding, than my wife with herself. Then she plots, then she ruminates, then she devises; and what they think in their hearts they may effect, they will break their hearts but they will effect. God be prais&#8217;d for my jealousy! Eleven o&#8217; clock the hour. I will prevent this, detect my wife, be reveng&#8217;d on Falstaff, and laugh at Page. I will about it; better three hours too soon than a minute too late.

<line globalnumber="815" number="40">Nay, you shall hear, Master Brook, what I have suffer&#8217;d to bring this woman to evil for your good. Being thus cramm&#8217;d in the basket, a couple of Ford&#8217;s knaves, his hinds, were call&#8217;d forth by their mistress to carry me in the name of foul clothes to Datchet-lane. They took me on their shoulders; met the jealous knave their master in the door, who ask&#8217;d them once or twice what they had in their basket. I quak&#8217;d for fear, lest the lunatic knave would have search&#8217;d it; but fate (ordaining he should be a cuckold) held his hand. Well, on went he for a search, and away went I for foul clothes. But mark the sequel, Master Brook. I suffer&#8217;d the pangs of three several deaths: first, an intolerable fright, to be detected with a jealous rotten bell-wether; next, to be compass&#8217;d like a good bilbo in the circumference of a peck, hilt to point, heel to head; and then to be stopp&#8217;d in like a strong distillation with stinking clothes that fretted in their own grease. Think of that&#8212;a man of my kidney. Think of that&#8212;that am as subject to heat as butter; a man of continual dissolution and thaw. It was a miracle to scape suffocation. And in the height of this bath (when I was more than half stew&#8217;d in grease, like a Dutch dish) to be thrown into the Thames, and cool&#8217;d, glowing-hot, in that surge, like a horse-shoe; think of that&#8212;hissing-hot&#8212;think of that, Master Brook.</line>
