<line globalnumber="2564" number="4">I make a broken delivery of the business; but the changes I perceiv&#8217;d in the King and Camillo were very notes of admiration. They seem&#8217;d almost, with staring on one another, to tear the cases of their eyes. There was speech in their dumbness, language in their very gesture; they look&#8217;d as they had heard of a world ransom&#8217;d, or one destroy&#8217;d. A notable passion of wonder appear&#8217;d in them; but the wisest beholder, that knew no more but seeing, could not say if th&#8217; importance were joy or sorrow; but in the extremity of the one, it must needs be.</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Third Gentleman">3. GENT.</speaker>
<line globalnumber="2568" number="8">Most true, if ever truth were pregnant by circumstance. That which you hear you&#8217;ll swear you see, there is such unity in the proofs. The mantle of Queen Hermione&#8217;s; her jewel about the neck of it; the letters of Antigonus found with it, which they know to be his character; the majesty of the creature in resemblance of the mother; the affection of nobleness which nature shows above her breeding; and many other evidences proclaim her, with all certainty, to be the King&#8217;s daughter. Did you see the meeting of the two kings?</line>

<speech>
<speaker long="Third Gentleman">3. GENT.</speaker>
<line globalnumber="2570" number="10">Then have you lost a sight which was to be seen, cannot be spoken of. There might you have beheld one joy crown another, so and in such manner that it seem&#8217;d sorrow wept to take leave of them, for their joy waded in tears. There was casting up of eyes, holding up of hands, with countenance of such distraction that they were to be known by garment, not by favor. Our king, being ready to leap out of himself for joy of his found daughter, as if that joy were now become a loss, cries, &#8220;O, thy mother, thy mother!&#8221;; then asks Bohemia forgiveness; then embraces his son-in-law; then again worries he his daughter with clipping her. Now he thanks the old shepherd, which stands by like a weather-bitten conduit of many kings&#8217; reigns. I never heard of such another encounter, which lames report to follow it, and undoes description to do it.</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Third Gentleman">3. GENT.</speaker>
<line globalnumber="2572" number="12">Like an old tale still, which will have matter to rehearse, though credit be asleep and not an ear open: he was torn to pieces with a bear. This avouches the shepherd&#8217;s son, who has not only his innocence (which seems much) to justify him, but a handkerchief and rings of his that Paulina knows.</line>

<speaker long="Third Gentleman">3. GENT.</speaker>
<line globalnumber="2574" number="14">Wrack&#8217;d the same instant of their master&#8217;s death, and in the view of the shepherd; so that all the instruments which aided to expose the child were even then lost when it was found. But O, the noble combat that &#8217;twixt joy and sorrow was fought in Paulina! She had one eye declin&#8217;d for the loss of her husband, another elevated that the oracle was fulfill&#8217;d. She lifted the Princess from the earth, and so locks her in embracing, as if she would pin her to her heart, that she might no more be in danger of losing.</line>
</speech>

<line globalnumber="2575" number="15">The dignity of this act was worth the audience of kings and princes, for by such was it acted.</line>

<speech>
<speaker long="Third Gentleman">3. GENT.</speaker>
<line globalnumber="2576" number="16">One of the prettiest touches of all, and that which angled for mine eyes (caught the water though not the fish), was when, at the relation of the Queen&#8217;s death (with the manner how she came to&#8217;t bravely confess&#8217;d and lamented by the King), how attentiveness wounded his daughter, till (from one sign of dolor to another) she did (with an &#8220;Alas!&#8221;), I would fain say, bleed tears; for I am sure my heart wept blood. Who was most marble there chang&#8217;d color; some swounded, all sorrow&#8217;d. If all the world could have seen&#8217;t, the woe had been universal.</line>

<line globalnumber="2578" number="18">No. The Princess hearing of her mother&#8217;s statue, which is in the keeping of Paulina&#8212;a piece many years in doing and now newly perform&#8217;d by that rare Italian master, Julio Romano, who, had he himself eternity and could put breath into his work, would beguile Nature of her custom, so perfectly he is her ape. He so near to Hermione hath done Hermione that they say one would speak to her and stand in hope of answer. Thither with all greediness of affection are they gone, and there they intend to sup.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Second Gentleman">2. GENT.</speaker>
<line globalnumber="2579" number="19">I thought she had some great matter there in hand, for she hath privately twice or thrice a day, ever since the death of Hermione, visited that remov&#8217;d house. Shall we thither, and with our company piece the rejoicing?</line>
