<line globalnumber="4" number="4">I am not partial to infringe our laws;</line>
<line globalnumber="5" number="5">The enmity and discord which of late</line>
<line globalnumber="6" number="6">Sprung from the rancorous outrage of your Duke</line>
<line globalnumber="7" number="7">To merchants, our well-dealing countrymen,</line>
<line globalnumber="8" number="8">Who, wanting guilders to redeem their lives,</line>
<line globalnumber="9" number="9">Have seal&#8217;d his rigorous statutes with their bloods,</line>
<line globalnumber="10" number="10">Excludes all pity from our threat&#8217;ning looks:</line>

<line globalnumber="12" number="12">&#8217;Twixt thy seditious countrymen and us,</line>
<line globalnumber="13" number="13">It hath in solemn synods been decreed,</line>
<line globalnumber="14" number="14">Both by the Syracusians and ourselves,</line>
<line globalnumber="15" number="15">To admit no traffic to our adverse towns:</line>
<line globalnumber="16" number="16">Nay more, if any born at Ephesus be seen</line>
<line globalnumber="17" number="17">At any Syracusian marts and fairs;</line>

<line globalnumber="28" number="28">Well, Syracusian; say in brief the cause</line>
<line globalnumber="29" number="29">Why thou departedst from thy native home,</line>
<line globalnumber="30" number="30">And for what cause thou cam&#8217;st to Ephesus.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Egeon">EGE.</speaker>
<line globalnumber="31" number="31">A heavier task could not have been impos&#8217;d</line>
<line globalnumber="32" number="32">Than I to speak my griefs unspeakable:</line>
<line globalnumber="33" number="33">Yet that the world may witness that my end</line>
<line globalnumber="34" number="34">Was wrought by nature, not by vile offense,</line>
<line globalnumber="35" number="35">I&#8217;ll utter what my sorrow gives me leave.</line>
<line globalnumber="36" number="36">In Syracuse was I born, and wed</line>
<line globalnumber="37" number="37">Unto a woman, happy but for me,</line>
<line globalnumber="38" number="38">And by me, had not our hap been bad:</line>
<line globalnumber="39" number="39">With her I liv&#8217;d in joy; our wealth increas&#8217;d</line>
<line globalnumber="40" number="40">By prosperous voyages I often made</line>
<line globalnumber="41" number="41">To Epidamium, till my factor&#8217;s death,</line>
<line globalnumber="42" number="42">And the great care of goods at random left,</line>
<line globalnumber="43" number="43">Drew me from kind embracements of my spouse;</line>
<line globalnumber="44" number="44">From whom my absence was not six months old</line>
<line globalnumber="45" number="45">Before herself (almost at fainting under</line>
<line globalnumber="46" number="46">The pleasing punishment that women bear)</line>
<line globalnumber="47" number="47">Had made provision for her following me,</line>
<line globalnumber="48" number="48">And soon, and safe, arrived where I was.</line>
<line globalnumber="49" number="49">There had she not been long but she became</line>
<line globalnumber="50" number="50">A joyful mother of two goodly sons:</line>
<line globalnumber="51" number="51">And, which was strange, the one so like the other</line>
<line globalnumber="52" number="52">As could not be distinguish&#8217;d but by names.</line>
<line globalnumber="53" number="53">That very hour, and in the self-same inn,</line>
<line globalnumber="54" number="54">A mean woman was delivered</line>
<line globalnumber="55" number="55">Of such a burden male, twins both alike.</line>
<line globalnumber="56" number="56">Those, for their parents were exceeding poor,</line>
<line globalnumber="57" number="57">I bought, and brought up to attend my sons.</line>
<line globalnumber="58" number="58">My wife, not meanly proud of two such boys,</line>
<line globalnumber="59" number="59">Made daily motions for our home return:</line>
<line globalnumber="60" number="60">Unwilling I agreed. Alas! Too soon</line>
<line globalnumber="61" number="61">We came aboard.</line>
<line globalnumber="62" number="62">A league from Epidamium had we sail&#8217;d</line>
<line globalnumber="63" number="63">Before the always-wind-obeying deep</line>
<line globalnumber="64" number="64">Gave any tragic instance of our harm:</line>
<line globalnumber="65" number="65">But longer did we not retain much hope;</line>
<line globalnumber="66" number="66">For what obscured light the heavens did grant</line>
<line globalnumber="67" number="67">Did but convey unto our fearful minds</line>
<line globalnumber="68" number="68">A doubtful warrant of immediate death,</line>
<line globalnumber="69" number="69">Which though myself would gladly have embrac&#8217;d,</line>
<line globalnumber="70" number="70">Yet the incessant weepings of my wife,</line>
<line globalnumber="71" number="71">Weeping before for what she saw must come,</line>
<line globalnumber="72" number="72">And piteous plainings of the pretty babes,</line>
<line globalnumber="73" number="73">That mourn&#8217;d for fashion, ignorant what to fear,</line>
<line globalnumber="74" number="74">Forc&#8217;d me to seek delays for them and me.</line>
<line globalnumber="75" number="75">And this it was (for other means was none):</line>
<line globalnumber="76" number="76">The sailors sought for safety by our boat,</line>
<line globalnumber="77" number="77">And left the ship, then sinking-ripe, to us.</line>
<line globalnumber="78" number="78">My wife, more careful for the latter-born,</line>
<line globalnumber="79" number="79">Had fast&#8217;ned him unto a small spare mast,</line>
<line globalnumber="80" number="80">Such as sea-faring men provide for storms;</line>
<line globalnumber="81" number="81">To him one of the other twins was bound,</line>
<line globalnumber="82" number="82">Whilst I had been like heedful of the other.</line>
<line globalnumber="83" number="83">The children thus dispos&#8217;d, my wife and I,</line>
<line globalnumber="84" number="84">Fixing our eyes on whom our care was fix&#8217;d,</line>
<line globalnumber="85" number="85">Fast&#8217;ned ourselves at either end the mast,</line>
<line globalnumber="86" number="86">And floating straight, obedient to the stream,</line>
<line globalnumber="87" number="87">Was carried towards Corinth, as we thought.</line>
<line globalnumber="88" number="88">At length the sun, gazing upon the earth,</line>
<line globalnumber="89" number="89">Dispers&#8217;d those vapors that offended us,</line>
<line globalnumber="90" number="90">And by the benefit of his wished light</line>
<line globalnumber="91" number="91">The seas wax&#8217;d calm, and we discovered</line>
<line globalnumber="92" number="92">Two ships from far, making amain to us,</line>
<line globalnumber="93" number="93">Of Corinth that, of Epidaurus this.</line>
<line globalnumber="94" number="94">But ere they came&#8212;O, let me say no more!</line>
<line globalnumber="95" number="95">Gather the sequel by that went before.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Solinus, Duke of Ephesus">DUKE.</speaker>
<line globalnumber="96" number="96">Nay, forward, old man, do not break off so,</line>
<line globalnumber="97" number="97">For we may pity, though not pardon thee.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Egeon">EGE.</speaker>
<line globalnumber="98" number="98">O, had the gods done so, I had not now</line>
<line globalnumber="99" number="99">Worthily term&#8217;d them merciless to us!</line>
<line globalnumber="100" number="100">For ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues,</line>
<line globalnumber="101" number="101">We were encount&#8217;red by a mighty rock,</line>
<line globalnumber="102" number="102">Which being violently borne upon,</line>
<line globalnumber="103" number="103">Our helpful ship was splitted in the midst;</line>
<line globalnumber="104" number="104">So that, in this unjust divorce of us,</line>
<line globalnumber="105" number="105">Fortune had left to both of us alike</line>
<line globalnumber="106" number="106">What to delight in, what to sorrow for.</line>
<line globalnumber="107" number="107">Her part, poor soul! Seeming as burdened</line>
<line globalnumber="108" number="108">With lesser weight, but not with lesser woe,</line>
<line globalnumber="109" number="109">Was carried with more speed before the wind,</line>
<line globalnumber="110" number="110">And in our sight they three were taken up</line>
<line globalnumber="111" number="111">By fishermen of Corinth, as we thought.</line>
<line globalnumber="112" number="112">At length, another ship had seiz&#8217;d on us,</line>
<line globalnumber="113" number="113">And knowing whom it was their hap to save,</line>
<line globalnumber="114" number="114">Gave healthful welcome to their shipwrack&#8217;d guests,</line>
<line globalnumber="115" number="115">And would have reft the fishers of their prey,</line>
<line globalnumber="116" number="116">Had not their bark been very slow of sail;</line>
<line globalnumber="117" number="117">And therefore homeward did they bend their course.</line>
<line globalnumber="118" number="118">Thus have you heard me sever&#8217;d from my bliss,</line>
<line globalnumber="119" number="119">That by misfortunes was my life prolong&#8217;d,</line>
<line globalnumber="120" number="120">To tell sad stories of my own mishaps.</line>
</speech>

<speaker long="Solinus, Duke of Ephesus">DUKE.</speaker>

<line globalnumber="124" number="124">My youngest boy, and yet my eldest care,</line>

<line globalnumber="130" number="130">Whom whilst I labored of a love to see,</line>
<line globalnumber="131" number="131">I hazarded the loss of whom I lov&#8217;d.</line>
<line globalnumber="132" number="132">Five summers have I spent in farthest Greece,</line>
<line globalnumber="133" number="133">Roaming clean through the bounds of Asia,</line>
<line globalnumber="134" number="134">And coasting homeward, came to Ephesus;</line>
<line globalnumber="135" number="135">Hopeless to find, yet loath to leave unsought</line>
<line globalnumber="136" number="136">Or that, or any place that harbors men.</line>
<line globalnumber="137" number="137">But here must end the story of my life,</line>

<speech>
<speaker long="Antipholus of Syracuse">S. ANT.</speaker>
