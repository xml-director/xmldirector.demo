<line globalnumber="1" number="1">Open your ears; for which of you will stop</line>
<line globalnumber="2" number="2">The vent of hearing when loud Rumor speaks?</line>
<line globalnumber="3" number="3">I, from the orient to the drooping west</line>
<line globalnumber="4" number="4">(Making the wind my post-horse), still unfold</line>
<line globalnumber="5" number="5">The acts commenced on this ball of earth.</line>
<line globalnumber="6" number="6">Upon my tongues continual slanders ride,</line>
<line globalnumber="7" number="7">The which in every language I pronounce,</line>
<line globalnumber="8" number="8">Stuffing the ears of men with false reports.</line>
<line globalnumber="9" number="9">I speak of peace, while covert enmity</line>
<line globalnumber="10" number="10">Under the smile of safety wounds the world;</line>
<line globalnumber="11" number="11">And who but Rumor, who but only I,</line>
<line globalnumber="12" number="12">Make fearful musters and prepar&#8217;d defense,</line>
<line globalnumber="13" number="13">Whiles the big year, swoll&#8217;n with some other grief,</line>
<line globalnumber="14" number="14">Is thought with child by the stern tyrant war,</line>
<line globalnumber="15" number="15">And no such matter? Rumor is a pipe</line>
<line globalnumber="16" number="16">Blown by surmises, jealousies, conjectures,</line>
<line globalnumber="17" number="17">And of so easy and so plain a stop</line>
<line globalnumber="18" number="18">That the blunt monster with uncounted heads,</line>
<line globalnumber="19" number="19">The still-discordant wav&#8217;ring multitude,</line>

<line globalnumber="21" number="21">My well-known body to anatomize</line>
<line globalnumber="22" number="22">Among my household? Why is Rumor here?</line>
<line globalnumber="23" number="23">I run before King Harry&#8217;s victory,</line>
<line globalnumber="24" number="24">Who in a bloody field by Shrewsbury</line>
<line globalnumber="25" number="25">Hath beaten down young Hotspur and his troops,</line>
<line globalnumber="26" number="26">Quenching the flame of bold rebellion</line>
<line globalnumber="27" number="27">Even with the rebels&#8217; blood. But what mean I</line>
<line globalnumber="28" number="28">To speak so true at first? My office is</line>
<line globalnumber="29" number="29">To noise abroad that Harry Monmouth fell</line>
<line globalnumber="30" number="30">Under the wrath of noble Hotspur&#8217;s sword,</line>
<line globalnumber="31" number="31">And that the King before the Douglas&#8217; rage</line>
<line globalnumber="32" number="32">Stoop&#8217;d his anointed head as low as death.</line>
<line globalnumber="33" number="33">This have I rumor&#8217;d through the peasant towns</line>
<line globalnumber="34" number="34">Between that royal field of Shrewsbury</line>
<line globalnumber="35" number="35">And this worm-eaten hold of ragged stone,</line>
<line globalnumber="36" number="36">Where Hotspur&#8217;s father, old Northumberland,</line>
<line globalnumber="37" number="37">Lies crafty-sick. The posts come tiring on,</line>
<line globalnumber="38" number="38">And not a man of them brings other news</line>
<line globalnumber="39" number="39">Than they have learnt of me. From Rumor&#8217;s tongues</line>
<line globalnumber="40" number="40">They bring smooth comforts false, worse than true wrongs.</line>

<line globalnumber="269" number="3">Men of all sorts take a pride to gird at me. The brain of this foolish-compounded clay, man, is not able to invent any thing that intends to laughter more than I invent or is invented on me: I am not only witty in myself, but the cause that wit is in other men. I do here walk before thee like a sow that hath overwhelm&#8217;d all her litter but one. If the Prince put thee into my service for any other reason than to set me off, why then I have no judgment. Thou whoreson mandrake, thou art fitter to be worn in my cap than to wait at my heels. I was never mann&#8217;d with an agot till now, but I will inset you neither in gold nor silver, but in vile apparel, and send you back again to your master for a jewel&#8212;the juvenal, the Prince your master, whose chin is not yet fledge. I will sooner have a beard grow in the palm of my hand than he shall get one of his cheek, and yet he will not stick to say his face is a face royal. God may finish it when he will, &#8217;tis not a hair amiss yet. He may keep it still at a face royal, for a barber shall never earn sixpence out of it; and yet he&#8217;ll be crowing as if he had writ man ever since his father was a bachelor. He may keep his own grace, but he&#8217;s almost out of mine, I can assure him. What said Master Dommelton about the satin for my short cloak and my slops?</line>

The whoreson smoothy-pates do now wear nothing but high shoes, and bunches of keys at their girdles, and if a man is through with them in honest taking up, then they must stand upon security. I had as live they would put ratsbane in my mouth as offer to stop it with security. I look&#8217;d &#8217;a should have sent me two and twenty yards of satin (as I am a true knight), and he sends me security! Well, he may sleep in security, for he hath the horn of abundance, and the lightness of his wife shines through it; and yet cannot he see, though he have his own lanthorn to light him.

I cannot tell. Virtue is of so little regard in these costermongers&#8217; times that true valor is turn&#8217;d berrord; pregnancy is made a tapster, and his quick wit wasted in giving reckonings; all the other gifts appertinent to man, as the malice of this age shapes them, are not worth a gooseberry.

The truth is, I am only old in judgment and understanding; and he that will caper with me for a thousand marks, let him lend me the money, and have at him! For the box of the year that the Prince gave you, he gave it like a rude prince, and you took it like a sensible lord. I have check&#8217;d him for it, and the young lion repents,</line>

For, by the Lord, I take but two shirts out with me, and I mean not to sweat extraordinarily. If it be a hot day, and I brandish any thing but a bottle, I would I might never spit white again. There is not a dangerous action can peep out his head but I am thrust upon it. Well, I cannot last ever, but it was alway yet the trick of our English nation, if they have a good thing, to make it too common. If ye will needs say I am an old man, you should give me rest.

This same starv&#8217;d justice hath done nothing but prate to me of the wildness of his youth, and the feats he hath done about Turnbull Street, and every third word a lie, duer paid to the hearer than the Turk&#8217;s tribute. I do remember him at Clement&#8217;s Inn, like a man made after supper of a cheese-paring. When &#8217;a was naked, he was for all the world like a fork&#8217;d redish, with a head fantastically carv&#8217;d upon it with a knife. &#8217;A was so forlorn, that his dimensions to any thick sight were invisible. &#8217;A was the very genius of famine, yet lecherous as a monkey, and the whores call&#8217;d him mandrake. &#8217;A came ever in the rearward of the fashion, and sung those tunes to the overscutch&#8217;d huswives that he heard the carmen whistle, and sware they were his fancies or his good-nights. And now is this Vice&#8217;s dagger become a squire, and talks as familiarly of John a&#8217; Gaunt as if he had been sworn brother to him, and I&#8217;ll be sworn &#8217;a ne&#8217;er saw him but once in the Tilt-yard, and then he burst his head for crowding among the marshal&#8217;s men. I saw it, and told John a&#8217; Gaunt he beat his own name, for you might have thrust him and all his apparel into an eel-skin. The case of a treble hoboy was a mansion for him, a court, and now has he land and beefs! Well, I&#8217;ll be acquainted with him if I return, and&#8217;t shall go hard but I&#8217;ll make him a philosopher&#8217;s two stones to me. If the young dace be a bait for the old pike, I see no reason in the law of nature but I may snap at him: let time shape, and there an end.</line>

<line globalnumber="1495" number="42">I would you had the wit, &#8217;twere better than your dukedom. Good faith, this same young sober-blooded boy doth not love me, nor a man cannot make him laugh, but that&#8217;s no marvel, he drinks no wine. There&#8217;s never none of these demure boys come to any proof, for thin drink doth so over-cool their blood, and making many fish-meals, that they fall into a kind of male green-sickness, and then when they marry, they get wenches. They are generally fools and cowards, which some of us should be too, but for inflammation. A good sherris-sack hath a twofold operation in it. It ascends me into the brain, dries me there all the foolish and dull and crudy vapors which environ it, makes it apprehensive, quick, forgetive, full of nimble, fiery, and delectable shapes, which deliver&#8217;d o&#8217;er to the voice, the tongue, which is the birth, becomes excellent wit. The second property of your excellent sherris is the warming of the blood, which before (cold and settled) left the liver white and pale, which is the badge of pusillanimity and cowardice; but the sherris warms it, and makes it course from the inwards to the parts&#8217; extremes. It illumineth the face, which as a beacon gives warning to all the rest of this little kingdom, man, to arm, and then the vital commoners and inland petty spirits muster me all to their captain, the heart, who great and puff&#8217;d up with this retinue, doth any deed of courage; and this valor comes of sherris. So that skill in the weapon is nothing without sack (for that sets it a-work) and learning a mere hoard of gold kept by a devil, till sack commences it and sets it in act and use. Hereof comes it that Prince Harry is valiant, for the cold blood he did naturally inherit of his father, he hath, like lean, sterile, and bare land, manur&#8217;d, husbanded, and till&#8217;d with excellent endeavor of drinking good and good store of fertile sherris, that he is become very hot and valiant. If I had a thousand sons, the first humane principle I would teach them should be, to forswear thin potations and to addict themselves to sack.</line>

It is a wonderful thing to see the semblable coherence of his men&#8217;s spirits and his. They, by observing him, do bear themselves like foolish justices; he, by conversing with them, is turn&#8217;d into a justice-like servingman. Their spirits are so married in conjunction with the participation of society that they flock together in consent, like so many wild geese. If I had a suit to Master Shallow, I would humor his men with the imputation of being near their master; if to his men, I would curry with Master Shallow that no man could better command his servants. It is certain that either wise bearing or ignorant carriage is caught, as men take diseases, one of another; therefore let men take heed of their company. I will devise matter enough out of this Shallow to keep Prince Harry in continual laughter the wearing out of six fashions, which is four terms, or two actions, and &#8217;a shall laugh without intervallums. O, it is much that a lie with a slight oath and a jest with a sad brow will do with a fellow that never had the ache in his shoulders! O, you shall see him laugh till his face be like a wet cloak ill laid up.</line>

<speaker long="Epilogue">EPILOGUE.</speaker>
<line globalnumber="2246" number="1">First my fear, then my cur&#8217;sy, last my speech. My fear, is your displeasure, my cur&#8217;sy, my duty, and my speech, to beg your pardons. If you look for a good speech now, you undo me, for what I have to say is of mine own making, and what indeed (I should say) will (I doubt) prove mine own marring. But to the purpose, and so to the venture. Be it known to you, as it is very well, I was lately here in the end of a displeasing play, to pray your patience for it and to promise you a better. I meant indeed to pay you with this, which if like an ill venture it come unluckily home, I break, and you, my gentle creditors, lose. Here I promis&#8217;d you I would be, and here I commit my body to your mercies. Bate me some, and I will pay you some, and (as most debtors do) promise you infinitely; and so I kneel down before you&#8212;but, indeed, to pray for the Queen.</line>
<line globalnumber="2247" number="2">If my tongue cannot entreat you to acquit me, will you command me to use my legs? And yet that were but light payment, to dance out of your debt. But a good conscience will make any possible satisfaction, and so would I. All the gentlewomen here have forgiven me; if the gentlemen will not, then the gentlemen do not agree with the gentlewomen, which was never seen in such an assembly.</line>
<line globalnumber="2248" number="3">One word more, I beseech you. If you be not too much cloy&#8217;d with fat meat, our humble author will continue the story, with Sir John in it, and make you merry with fair Katherine of France, where (for any thing I know) Falstaff shall die of a sweat, unless already &#8217;a be kill&#8217;d with your hard opinions; for Oldcastle died a martyr, and this is not the man. My tongue is weary, when my legs are too, I will bid you good night.</line>
