<line globalnumber="1428" number="331">Now, York, or never, steel thy fearful thoughts,</line>

<line globalnumber="1430" number="333">Be that thou hop&#8217;st to be, or what thou art</line>

<line globalnumber="1432" number="335">Let pale-fac&#8217;d fear keep with the mean-born man,</line>
<line globalnumber="1433" number="336">And find no harbor in a royal heart.</line>
<line globalnumber="1434" number="337">Faster than spring-time show&#8217;rs comes thought on thought,</line>
<line globalnumber="1435" number="338">And not a thought but thinks on dignity.</line>
<line globalnumber="1436" number="339">My brain, more busy than the laboring spider,</line>
<line globalnumber="1437" number="340">Weaves tedious snares to trap mine enemies.</line>
<line globalnumber="1438" number="341">Well, nobles, well; &#8217;tis politicly done,</line>
<line globalnumber="1439" number="342">To send me packing with an host of men:</line>
<line globalnumber="1440" number="343">I fear me you but warm the starved snake,</line>
<line globalnumber="1441" number="344">Who, cherish&#8217;d in your breasts, will sting your hearts.</line>
<line globalnumber="1442" number="345">&#8217;Twas men I lack&#8217;d, and you will give them me;</line>
<line globalnumber="1443" number="346">I take it kindly. Yet be well assur&#8217;d</line>
<line globalnumber="1444" number="347">You put sharp weapons in a madman&#8217;s hands.</line>
<line globalnumber="1445" number="348">Whiles I in Ireland nourish a mighty band,</line>
<line globalnumber="1446" number="349">I will stir up in England some black storm</line>
<line globalnumber="1447" number="350">Shall blow ten thousand souls to heaven or hell;</line>
<line globalnumber="1448" number="351">And this fell tempest shall not cease to rage</line>
<line globalnumber="1449" number="352">Until the golden circuit on my head,</line>
<line globalnumber="1450" number="353">Like to the glorious sun&#8217;s transparent beams,</line>
<line globalnumber="1451" number="354">Do calm the fury of this mad-bred flaw.</line>
<line globalnumber="1452" number="355">And for a minister of my intent,</line>
<line globalnumber="1453" number="356">I have seduc&#8217;d a headstrong Kentishman,</line>
<line globalnumber="1454" number="357">John Cade of Ashford,</line>
<line globalnumber="1455" number="358">To make commotion, as full well he can,</line>
<line globalnumber="1456" number="359">Under the title of John Mortimer.</line>
<line globalnumber="1457" number="360">In Ireland have I seen this stubborn Cade</line>
<line globalnumber="1458" number="361">Oppose himself against a troop of kerns,</line>
<line globalnumber="1459" number="362">And fought so long, till that his thighs with darts</line>
<line globalnumber="1460" number="363">Were almost like a sharp-quill&#8217;d porpentine;</line>
<line globalnumber="1461" number="364">And in the end being rescued, I have seen</line>
<line globalnumber="1462" number="365">Him caper upright like a wild Morisco,</line>
<line globalnumber="1463" number="366">Shaking the bloody darts as he his bells.</line>
<line globalnumber="1464" number="367">Full often, like a shag-hair&#8217;d crafty kern,</line>
<line globalnumber="1465" number="368">Hath he conversed with the enemy,</line>
<line globalnumber="1466" number="369">And undiscover&#8217;d come to me again,</line>
<line globalnumber="1467" number="370">And given me notice of their villainies.</line>
<line globalnumber="1468" number="371">This devil here shall be my substitute;</line>
<line globalnumber="1469" number="372">For that John Mortimer, which now is dead,</line>
<line globalnumber="1470" number="373">In face, in gait, in speech, he doth resemble.</line>
<line globalnumber="1471" number="374">By this I shall perceive the commons&#8217; mind,</line>
<line globalnumber="1472" number="375">How they affect the house and claim of York.</line>
<line globalnumber="1473" number="376">Say he be taken, rack&#8217;d, and tortured,</line>
<line globalnumber="1474" number="377">I know no pain they can inflict upon him</line>
<line globalnumber="1475" number="378">Will make him say I mov&#8217;d him to those arms.</line>
<line globalnumber="1476" number="379">Say that he thrive, as &#8217;tis great like he will,</line>
<line globalnumber="1477" number="380">Why then from Ireland come I with my strength,</line>
<line globalnumber="1478" number="381">And reap the harvest which that rascal sow&#8217;d.</line>
<line globalnumber="1479" number="382">For Humphrey being dead, as he shall be,</line>
<line globalnumber="1480" number="383">And Henry put apart, the next for me.</line>

It will be prov&#8217;d to thy face that thou hast men about thee that usually talk of a noun and a verb, and such abominable words as no Christian ear can endure to hear. Thou hast appointed justices of peace, to call poor men before them about matters they were not able to answer.

These five days have I hid me in these woods and durst not peep out, for all the country is laid for me; but now am I so hungry that, if I might have a lease of my life for a thousand years, I could stay no longer. Wherefore, on a brick wall have I climb&#8217;d into this garden, to see if I can eat grass, or pick a sallet another while, which is not amiss to cool a man&#8217;s stomach this hot weather. And I think this word &#8217;sallet&#8217; was born to do me good; for many a time, but for a sallet, my brain-pan had been cleft with a brown bill; and many a time, when I have been dry and bravely marching, it hath serv&#8217;d me instead of a quart pot to drink in; and now the word &#8216;sallet&#8217; must serve me to feed on.</line>
