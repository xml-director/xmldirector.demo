But this reasoning is not in the fashion to choose me a husband. O me, the word choose! I may neither choose who I would, nor refuse who I dislike; 
so is the will of a living daughter curb&#8217;d by the will of a dead father. Is it not hard, Nerissa, that I cannot choose one, nor refuse none?</line>

But ships are but boards, sailors but men; there be land-rats and water-rats, water-thieves and land-thieves, I mean pirates, and then there is the peril of waters, winds, and rocks.

Well, the most courageous fiend bids me pack. &#8220;Fia!&#8221; says the fiend; &#8220;away!&#8221; says the fiend; &#8220;for the heavens, rouse up a brave mind,&#8221; says the fiend, &#8220;and run.&#8221; Well, my conscience, hanging about the neck of my heart, says very wisely to me, &#8220;My honest friend Launcelot, being an honest man&#8217;s son&#8221;&#8212;or rather an honest woman&#8217;s son, for indeed my father did something smack, something grow to, he had a kind of taste&#8212;well, my conscience says, &#8220;Launcelot, bouge not.&#8221; &#8220;Bouge,&#8221; says the fiend. &#8220;Bouge not,&#8221; says my conscience. &#8220;Conscience,&#8221; say I, &#8220;you counsel well.&#8221; &#8220;Fiend,&#8221; say I, &#8220;you counsel well.&#8221; To be rul&#8217;d by my conscience, I should stay with the Jew my master, who (God bless the mark) is a kind of devil; and to run away from the Jew, I should be rul&#8217;d by the fiend, who, saving your reverence, is the devil himself. Certainly the Jew is the very devil incarnation, and in my conscience, my conscience is but a kind of hard conscience, to offer to counsel me to stay with the Jew.

<line globalnumber="2276" number="293">And yet I am sure you are not satisfied</line>
<line globalnumber="2277" number="294">Of these events at full. Let us go in,</line>

<line globalnumber="2281" number="298">That my Nerissa shall be sworn on is,</line>
<line globalnumber="2282" number="299">Whether till the next night she had rather stay,</line>
<line globalnumber="2283" number="300">Or go to bed now, being two hours to day.</line>
<line globalnumber="2284" number="301">But were the day come, I should wish it dark</line>
<line globalnumber="2285" number="302">Till I were couching with the doctor&#8217;s clerk.</line>
<line globalnumber="2286" number="303">Well, while I live I&#8217;ll fear no other thing</line>
