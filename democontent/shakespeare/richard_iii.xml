<line globalnumber="1" number="1">Now is the winter of our discontent</line>
<line globalnumber="2" number="2">Made glorious summer by this son of York;</line>
<line globalnumber="3" number="3">And all the clouds that low&#8217;r&#8217;d upon our house</line>
<line globalnumber="4" number="4">In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.</line>
<line globalnumber="5" number="5">Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths,</line>
<line globalnumber="6" number="6">Our bruised arms hung up for monuments,</line>
<line globalnumber="7" number="7">Our stern alarums chang&#8217;d to merry meetings,</line>
<line globalnumber="8" number="8">Our dreadful marches to delightful measures.</line>
<line globalnumber="9" number="9">Grim-visag&#8217;d War hath smooth&#8217;d his wrinkled front;</line>
<line globalnumber="10" number="10">And now, in stead of mounting barbed steeds</line>
<line globalnumber="11" number="11">To fright the souls of fearful adversaries,</line>
<line globalnumber="12" number="12">He capers nimbly in a lady&#8217;s chamber</line>
<line globalnumber="13" number="13">To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.</line>
<line globalnumber="14" number="14">But I, that am not shap&#8217;d for sportive tricks,</line>
<line globalnumber="15" number="15">Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass;</line>
<line globalnumber="16" number="16">I, that am rudely stamp&#8217;d, and want love&#8217;s majesty</line>
<line globalnumber="17" number="17">To strut before a wanton ambling nymph;</line>
<line globalnumber="18" number="18">I, that am curtail&#8217;d of this fair proportion,</line>
<line globalnumber="19" number="19">Cheated of feature by dissembling nature,</line>
<line globalnumber="20" number="20">Deform&#8217;d, unfinish&#8217;d, sent before my time</line>
<line globalnumber="21" number="21">Into this breathing world, scarce half made up,</line>
<line globalnumber="22" number="22">And that so lamely and unfashionable</line>
<line globalnumber="23" number="23">That dogs bark at me as I halt by them&#8212;</line>
<line globalnumber="24" number="24">Why, I, in this weak piping time of peace,</line>
<line globalnumber="25" number="25">Have no delight to pass away the time,</line>
<line globalnumber="26" number="26">Unless to see my shadow in the sun</line>
<line globalnumber="27" number="27">And descant on mine own deformity.</line>
<line globalnumber="28" number="28">And therefore, since I cannot prove a lover</line>
<line globalnumber="29" number="29">To entertain these fair well-spoken days,</line>
<line globalnumber="30" number="30">I am determined to prove a villain</line>
<line globalnumber="31" number="31">And hate the idle pleasures of these days.</line>
<line globalnumber="32" number="32">Plots have I laid, inductions dangerous,</line>
<line globalnumber="33" number="33">By drunken prophecies, libels, and dreams,</line>
<line globalnumber="34" number="34">To set my brother Clarence and the King</line>
<line globalnumber="35" number="35">In deadly hate the one against the other;</line>
<line globalnumber="36" number="36">And if King Edward be as true and just</line>
<line globalnumber="37" number="37">As I am subtle, false, and treacherous,</line>
<line globalnumber="38" number="38">This day should Clarence closely be mew&#8217;d up</line>
<line globalnumber="39" number="39">About a prophecy, which says that G</line>
<line globalnumber="40" number="40">Of Edward&#8217;s heirs the murderer shall be.</line>

<speaker long="George, Duke of Clarence">CLAR.</speaker>
<line globalnumber="54" number="52">Yea, Richard, when I know; but I protest</line>
<line globalnumber="55" number="53">As yet I do not. But, as I can learn,</line>
<line globalnumber="56" number="54">He hearkens after prophecies and dreams,</line>
<line globalnumber="57" number="55">And from the cross-row plucks the letter G,</line>
<line globalnumber="58" number="56">And says a wizard told him that by G</line>
<line globalnumber="59" number="57">His issue disinherited should be;</line>
<line globalnumber="60" number="58">And for my name of George begins with G,</line>
<line globalnumber="61" number="59">It follows in his thought that I am he.</line>
<line globalnumber="62" number="60">These (as I learn) and such-like toys as these</line>
<line globalnumber="63" number="61">Hath mov&#8217;d his Highness to commit me now.</line>

<speech>
<speaker long="Richard, Duke of Gloucester">GLOU.</speaker>
<line globalnumber="64" number="62">Why, this it is, when men are rul&#8217;d by women:</line>
<line globalnumber="65" number="63">&#8217;Tis not the King that sends you to the Tower;</line>
<line globalnumber="66" number="64">My Lady Grey his wife, Clarence, &#8217;tis she</line>
<line globalnumber="67" number="65">That tempers him to this extremity.</line>
<line globalnumber="68" number="66">Was it not she, and that good man of worship,</line>
<line globalnumber="69" number="67">Anthony Woodvile, her brother there,</line>
<line globalnumber="70" number="68">That made him send Lord Hastings to the Tower,</line>
<line globalnumber="71" number="69">From whence this present day he is delivered?</line>

<line globalnumber="75" number="73">That trudge betwixt the King and Mistress Shore.</line>

<line globalnumber="94" number="92">Well strook in years, fair, and not jealous;</line>

<line globalnumber="2181" number="124">Whiles in the mildness of your sleepy thoughts,</line>
<line globalnumber="2182" number="125">Which here we waken to our country&#8217;s good,</line>

<line globalnumber="2185" number="128">Her royal stock graft with ignoble plants,</line>
<line globalnumber="2186" number="129">And almost should&#8217;red in the swallowing gulf</line>
<line globalnumber="2187" number="130">Of dark forgetfulness and deep oblivion.</line>
<line globalnumber="2188" number="131">Which to recure, we heartily solicit</line>
<line globalnumber="2189" number="132">Your gracious self to take on you the charge</line>
<line globalnumber="2190" number="133">And kingly government of this your land:</line>

<line globalnumber="2192" number="135">Or lowly factor for another&#8217;s gain;</line>
<line globalnumber="2193" number="136">But as successively, from blood to blood,</line>
<line globalnumber="2194" number="137">Your right of birth, your empery, your own.</line>
<line globalnumber="2195" number="138">For this, consorted with the citizens,</line>

<line globalnumber="2200" number="143">Or bitterly to speak in your reproof,</line>
<line globalnumber="2201" number="144">Best fitteth my degree or your condition.</line>
<line globalnumber="2202" number="145">If not to answer, you might haply think</line>

<line globalnumber="2207" number="150">So season&#8217;d with your faithful love to me,</line>

<line globalnumber="2210" number="153">And then, in speaking, not to incur the last&#8212;</line>
<line globalnumber="2211" number="154">Definitively thus I answer you:</line>
<line globalnumber="2212" number="155">Your love deserves my thanks, but my desert</line>
<line globalnumber="2213" number="156">Unmeritable shuns your high request.</line>
<line globalnumber="2214" number="157">First, if all obstacles were cut away,</line>
<line globalnumber="2215" number="158">And that my path were even to the crown,</line>
<line globalnumber="2216" number="159">As the ripe revenue and due of birth,</line>
<line globalnumber="2217" number="160">Yet so much is my poverty of spirit,</line>
<line globalnumber="2218" number="161">So mighty and so many my defects,</line>
<line globalnumber="2219" number="162">That I would rather hide me from my greatness&#8212;</line>

<line globalnumber="2222" number="165">And in the vapor of my glory smother&#8217;d.</line>
<line globalnumber="2223" number="166">But God be thank&#8217;d, there is no need of me,</line>
<line globalnumber="2224" number="167">And much I need to help you, were there need:</line>
<line globalnumber="2225" number="168">The royal tree hath left us royal fruit,</line>
<line globalnumber="2226" number="169">Which mellow&#8217;d by the stealing hours of time,</line>
<line globalnumber="2227" number="170">Will well become the seat of majesty,</line>

<line globalnumber="2235" number="178">You say that Edward is your brother&#8217;s son:</line>
<line globalnumber="2236" number="179">So say we too, but not by Edward&#8217;s wife;</line>
<line globalnumber="2237" number="180">For first was he contract to Lady Lucy&#8212;</line>
<line globalnumber="2238" number="181">Your mother lives a witness to his vow&#8212;</line>

<line globalnumber="2240" number="183">To Bona, sister to the King of France.</line>
<line globalnumber="2241" number="184">These both put off, a poor petitioner,</line>
<line globalnumber="2242" number="185">A care-craz&#8217;d mother to a many sons,</line>
