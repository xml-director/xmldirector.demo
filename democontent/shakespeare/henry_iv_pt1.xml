<line globalnumber="1" number="1">So shaken as we are, so wan with care,</line>
<line globalnumber="2" number="2">Find we a time for frighted peace to pant</line>
<line globalnumber="3" number="3">And breathe short-winded accents of new broils</line>
<line globalnumber="4" number="4">To be commenc&#8217;d in stronds afar remote.</line>
<line globalnumber="5" number="5">No more the thirsty entrance of this soil</line>
<line globalnumber="6" number="6">Shall daub her lips with her own children&#8217;s blood,</line>
<line globalnumber="7" number="7">No more shall trenching war channel her fields,</line>
<line globalnumber="8" number="8">Nor bruise her flow&#8217;rets with the armed hoofs</line>
<line globalnumber="9" number="9">Of hostile paces. Those opposed eyes,</line>
<line globalnumber="10" number="10">Which, like the meteors of a troubled heaven,</line>
<line globalnumber="11" number="11">All of one nature, of one substance bred,</line>
<line globalnumber="12" number="12">Did lately meet in the intestine shock</line>
<line globalnumber="13" number="13">And furious close of civil butchery,</line>
<line globalnumber="14" number="14">Shall now, in mutual well-beseeming ranks,</line>
<line globalnumber="15" number="15">March all one way and be no more oppos&#8217;d</line>
<line globalnumber="16" number="16">Against acquaintance, kindred, and allies.</line>
<line globalnumber="17" number="17">The edge of war, like an ill-sheathed knife,</line>

<line globalnumber="19" number="19">As far as to the sepulchre of Christ&#8212;</line>
<line globalnumber="20" number="20">Whose soldier now, under whose blessed cross</line>
<line globalnumber="21" number="21">We are impressed and engag&#8217;d to fight&#8212;</line>
<line globalnumber="22" number="22">Forthwith a power of English shall we levy,</line>

<line globalnumber="32" number="32">What yesternight our Council did decree</line>

<speech>
<speaker long="Earl of Westmorland">WEST.</speaker>
<line globalnumber="34" number="34">My liege, this haste was hot in question.</line>
<line globalnumber="35" number="35">And many limits of the charge set down</line>
<line globalnumber="36" number="36">But yesternight, when all athwart there came</line>
<line globalnumber="37" number="37">A post from Wales loaden with heavy news,</line>
<line globalnumber="38" number="38">Whose worst was that the noble Mortimer,</line>
<line globalnumber="39" number="39">Leading the men of Herfordshire to fight</line>
<line globalnumber="40" number="40">Against the irregular and wild Glendower,</line>
<line globalnumber="41" number="41">Was by the rude hands of that Welshman taken,</line>
<line globalnumber="42" number="42">A thousand of his people butchered,</line>
<line globalnumber="43" number="43">Upon whose dead corpse&#8217; there was such misuse,</line>
<line globalnumber="44" number="44">Such beastly shameless transformation,</line>
<line globalnumber="45" number="45">By those Welshwomen done as may not be</line>
<line globalnumber="46" number="46">Without much shame retold or spoken of.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="King Henry IV">KING.</speaker>
<line globalnumber="47" number="47">It seems then that the tidings of this broil</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Earl of Westmorland">WEST.</speaker>
<line globalnumber="49" number="49">This match&#8217;d with other did, my gracious lord,</line>
<line globalnumber="50" number="50">For more uneven and unwelcome news</line>
<line globalnumber="51" number="51">Came from the north, and thus it did import:</line>
<line globalnumber="52" number="52">On Holy-rood day, the gallant Hotspur there,</line>
<line globalnumber="53" number="53">Young Harry Percy, and brave Archibald,</line>
<line globalnumber="54" number="54">That ever-valiant and approved Scot,</line>
<line globalnumber="55" number="55">At Holmedon met,</line>
<line globalnumber="56" number="56">Where they did spend a sad and bloody hour,</line>
<line globalnumber="57" number="57">As by discharge of their artillery</line>
<line globalnumber="58" number="58">And shape of likelihood the news was told;</line>
<line globalnumber="59" number="59">For he that brought them, in the very heat</line>
<line globalnumber="60" number="60">And pride of their contention did take horse,</line>
<line globalnumber="61" number="61">Uncertain of the issue any way.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="King Henry IV">KING.</speaker>
<line globalnumber="62" number="62">Here is a dear, a true industrious friend,</line>
<line globalnumber="63" number="63">Sir Walter Blunt, new lighted from his horse,</line>
<line globalnumber="64" number="64">Stain&#8217;d with the variation of each soil</line>
<line globalnumber="65" number="65">Betwixt that Holmedon and this seat of ours;</line>
<line globalnumber="66" number="66">And he hath brought us smooth and welcome news.</line>
<line globalnumber="67" number="67">The Earl of Douglas is discomfited:</line>
<line globalnumber="68" number="68">Ten thousand bold Scots, two and twenty knights,</line>
<line globalnumber="69" number="69">Balk&#8217;d in their own blood, did Sir Walter see</line>
<line globalnumber="70" number="70">On Holmedon&#8217;s plains. Of prisoners, Hotspur took</line>
<line globalnumber="71" number="71">Mordake Earl of Fife and eldest son</line>
<line globalnumber="72" number="72">To beaten Douglas, and the Earl of Athol,</line>
<line globalnumber="73" number="73">Of Murray, Angus, and Menteith.</line>
<line globalnumber="74" number="74">And is not this an honorable spoil?</line>
<line globalnumber="75" number="75">A gallant prize? Ha, cousin, is it not?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Earl of Westmorland">WEST.</speaker>
<line globalnumber="76" number="76">In faith,</line>
<line globalnumber="77" number="77">It is a conquest for a prince to boast of.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="King Henry IV">KING.</speaker>
<line globalnumber="78" number="78">Yea, there thou mak&#8217;st me sad, and mak&#8217;st me sin</line>
<line globalnumber="79" number="79">In envy that my Lord Northumberland</line>
<line globalnumber="80" number="80">Should be the father to so blest a son&#8212;</line>
<line globalnumber="81" number="81"> A son who is the theme of honor&#8217;s tongue,</line>
<line globalnumber="82" number="82">Amongst a grove the very straightest plant,</line>
<line globalnumber="83" number="83">Who is sweet Fortune&#8217;s minion and her pride,</line>
<line globalnumber="84" number="84">Whilst I, by looking on the praise of him,</line>
<line globalnumber="85" number="85">See riot and dishonor stain the brow</line>
<line globalnumber="86" number="86">Of my young Harry. O that it could be prov&#8217;d</line>
<line globalnumber="87" number="87">That some night-tripping fairy had exchang&#8217;d</line>
<line globalnumber="88" number="88">In cradle-clothes our children where they lay,</line>
<line globalnumber="89" number="89">And call&#8217;d mine Percy, his Plantagenet!</line>
<line globalnumber="90" number="90">Then would I have his Harry and he mine.</line>
<line globalnumber="91" number="91">But let him from my thoughts. What think you, coz,</line>
<line globalnumber="92" number="92">Of this young Percy&#8217;s pride? The prisoners</line>
<line globalnumber="93" number="93">Which he in this adventure hath surpris&#8217;d</line>
<line globalnumber="94" number="94">To his own use he keeps, and sends me word</line>
<line globalnumber="95" number="95">I shall have none but Mordake Earl of Fife.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Earl of Westmorland">WEST.</speaker>
<line globalnumber="96" number="96">This is his uncle&#8217;s teaching; this is Worcester,</line>
<line globalnumber="97" number="97">Malevolent to you in all aspects,</line>
<line globalnumber="98" number="98">Which makes him prune himself, and bristle up</line>
<line globalnumber="99" number="99">The crest of youth against your dignity.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="King Henry IV">KING.</speaker>
<line globalnumber="100" number="100">But I have sent for him to answer this;</line>
<line globalnumber="101" number="101">And for this cause a while we must neglect</line>
<line globalnumber="102" number="102">Our holy purpose to Jerusalem.</line>
<line globalnumber="103" number="103">Cousin, on Wednesday next our Council we</line>
<line globalnumber="104" number="104">Will hold at Windsor, so inform the lords.</line>
<line globalnumber="105" number="105">But come yourself with speed to us again,</line>
<line globalnumber="106" number="106">For more is to be said and to be done</line>
<line globalnumber="107" number="107">Than out of anger can be uttered.</line>

<line globalnumber="109" number="1">Now, Hal, what time of day is it, lad?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Henry, Prince of Wales">PRINCE.</speaker>
<line globalnumber="110" number="2">Thou art so fat-witted with drinking of old sack, and unbuttoning thee after supper, and sleeping upon benches after noon, that thou hast forgotten to demand that truly which thou wouldest truly know. What a devil hast thou to do with the time of the day? Unless hours were cups of sack, and minutes capons, and clocks the tongues of bawds, and dials the signs of leaping-houses, and the blessed sun himself a fair hot wench in flame-color&#8217;d taffata; I see no reason why thou shouldst be so superfluous to demand the time of the day.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Sir John Falstaff">FAL.</speaker>
<line globalnumber="111" number="3">Indeed you come near me now, Hal, for we that take purses go by the moon and the seven stars, and not by Phoebus, he, &#8220;that wand&#8217;ring knight so fair.&#8221; And I prithee, sweet wag, when thou art a king, as, God save thy Grace&#8212;Majesty I should say, for grace thou wilt have none&#8212;</line>

<speech>

<line globalnumber="115" number="7">Marry, then, sweet wag, when thou art king, let not us that are squires of the night&#8217;s body be call&#8217;d thieves of the day&#8217;s beauty. Let us be Diana&#8217;s foresters, gentlemen of the shade, minions of the moon, and let men say we be men of good government, being govern&#8217;d, as the sea is, by our noble and chaste mistress the moon, under whose countenance we steal.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Henry, Prince of Wales">PRINCE.</speaker>
<line globalnumber="116" number="8">Thou sayest well, and it holds well too, for the fortune of us that are the moon&#8217;s men doth ebb and flow like the sea, being govern&#8217;d, as the sea is, by the moon. As, for proof, now: a purse of gold most resolutely snatch&#8217;d on Monday night and most dissolutely spent on Tuesday morning; got with swearing &#8220;Lay by,&#8221; and spent with crying &#8220;Bring in&#8221;; now in as low an ebb as the foot of the ladder, and by and by in as high a flow as the ridge of the gallows.</line>

<speech>
<speaker long="Henry, Prince of Wales">PRINCE.</speaker>
<line globalnumber="118" number="10">As the honey of Hybla, my old lad of the castle. And is not a buff jerkin a most sweet robe of durance?</line>

<line globalnumber="125" number="17">Yea, and so us&#8217;d it that, were it not here apparent that thou art heir apparent&#8212;But I prithee, sweet wag, shall there be gallows standing in England when thou art king? And resolution thus fubb&#8217;d as it is with the rusty curb of old father antic the law? Do not thou, when thou art king, hang a thief.</line>

<speech>
<speaker long="Sir John Falstaff">FAL.</speaker>
<line globalnumber="135" number="27">Thou hast the most unsavory similes and art indeed the most comparative, rascalliest, sweet young prince. But, Hal, I prithee trouble me no more with vanity; I would to God thou and I knew where a commodity of good names were to be bought. An old lord of the Council rated me the other day in the street about you, sir, but I mark&#8217;d him not, and yet he talk&#8217;d very wisely, but I regarded him not, and yet he talk&#8217;d wisely, and in the street too.</line>
</speech>

<line globalnumber="137" number="29">O, thou hast damnable iteration, and art indeed able to corrupt a saint. Thou hast done much harm upon me, Hal, God forgive thee for it! Before I knew thee, Hal, I knew nothing, and now am I, if a man should speak truly, little better than one of the wicked. I must give over this life, and I will give it over. By the Lord, and I do not, I am a villain, I&#8217;ll be damn&#8217;d for never a king&#8217;s son in Christendom.</line>

Tut, there are other Troyans that thou dream&#8217;st not of, the which for sport sake are content to do the profession some grace, that would (if matters should be look&#8217;d into) for their own credit sake make all whole. I am join&#8217;d with no foot land-rakers, no long-staff sixpenny strikers, none of these mad mustachio purple-hu&#8217;d malt-worms, but with nobility and tranquility, burgomasters and great oney&#8217;rs, such as can hold in, such as will strike sooner than speak, and speak sooner than drink, and drink sooner than pray; and yet, &#8217;zounds, I lie, for they pray continually to their saint, the commonwealth, or rather, not pray to her, but prey on her, for they ride up and down on her, and make her their boots.</line>

Sirrah, I am sworn brother to a leash of drawers, and can call them all by their christen names, as Tom, Dick, and Francis. They take it already upon their salvation, that though I be but Prince of Wales, yet I am the king of courtesy, and tell me flatly I am no proud Jack like Falstaff, but a Corinthian, a lad of mettle, a good boy (by the Lord, so they call me!), and when I am King of England I shall command all the good lads in Eastcheap. They call drinking deep, dyeing scarlet, and when you breathe in your watering, they cry &#8220;hem!&#8221; and bid you play it off. To conclude, I am so good a proficient in one quarter of an hour, that I can drink with any tinker in his own language during my life. I tell thee, Ned, thou hast lost much honor that thou wert not with me in this action. But, sweet Ned&#8212;to sweeten which name of Ned, I give thee this pennyworth of sugar, clapp&#8217;d even now into my hand by an under-skinker, one that never spake other English in his life than &#8220;Eight shillings and sixpence,&#8221; and &#8220;You are welcome,&#8221; with this shrill addition, &#8220;Anon, anon, sir! Score a pint of bastard in the Half-moon,&#8221; or so. But, Ned, to drive away the time till Falstaff come, I prithee do thou stand in some by-room, while I question my puny drawer to what end he gave me the sugar, and do thou never leave calling &#8220;Francis,&#8221; that his tale to me may be nothing but &#8220;Anon.&#8221; Step aside, and I&#8217;ll show thee a president.</line>

Harry, I do not only marvel where thou spendest thy time, but also how thou art accompanied; for though the camomile, the more it is trodden on, the faster it grows, yet youth, the more it is wasted, the sooner it wears. That thou art my son I have partly thy mother&#8217;s word, partly my own opinion, but chiefly a villainous trick of thine eye, and a foolish hanging of thy nether lip, that doth warrant me. If then thou be son to me, here lies the point: why being son to me, art thou so pointed at? Shall the blessed sun of heaven prove a micher and eat blackberries? A question not to be ask&#8217;d. Shall the son of England prove a thief and take purses? A question to be ask&#8217;d. There is a thing, Harry, which thou hast often heard of, and it is known to many in our land by the name of pitch. This pitch (as ancient writers do report) doth defile, so doth the company thou keepest; for, Harry, now I do not speak to thee in drink, but in tears; not in pleasure, but in passion; not in words only, but in woes also. And yet there is a virtuous man whom I have often noted in thy company, but I know not his name.</line>

If that man should be lewdly given, he deceiveth me; for, Harry, I see virtue in his looks. If then the tree may be known by the fruit, as the fruit by the tree, then peremptorily I speak it, there is virtue in that Falstaff; him keep with, the rest banish.

Wherein is he good, but to taste sack and drink it? Wherein neat and cleanly, but to carve a capon and eat it? Wherein cunning, but in craft? Wherein crafty, but in villainy? Wherein villainous, but in all things? Wherein worthy, but in nothing?</line>

If to be old and merry be a sin, then many an old host that I know is damn&#8217;d. If to be fat be to be hated, then Pharaoh&#8217;s lean kine are to be lov&#8217;d.

<line globalnumber="1215" number="49">Others would say, &#8220;Where, which is Bullingbrook?&#8221;</line>
<line globalnumber="1216" number="50">And then I stole all courtesy from heaven,</line>

<line globalnumber="1220" number="54">Even in the presence of the crowned King.</line>
<line globalnumber="1221" number="55">Thus did I keep my person fresh and new,</line>
<line globalnumber="1222" number="56">My presence, like a robe pontifical,</line>

<line globalnumber="1229" number="63">Mingled his royalty with cap&#8217;ring fools,</line>
<line globalnumber="1230" number="64">Had his great name profaned with their scorns,</line>
<line globalnumber="1231" number="65">And gave his countenance, against his name,</line>
<line globalnumber="1232" number="66">To laugh at gibing boys, and stand the push</line>
<line globalnumber="1233" number="67">Of every beardless vain comparative,</line>

<line globalnumber="1235" number="69">Enfeoff&#8217;d himself to popularity,</line>

I have got, in exchange of a hundred and fifty soldiers, three hundred and odd pounds. I press me none but good householders, yeomen&#8217;s sons, inquire me out contracted bachelors, such as had been ask&#8217;d twice on the banes, such a commodity of warm slaves, as had as lieve hear the devil as a drum, such as fear the report of a caliver worse than a struck fowl or a hurt wild duck. I press&#8217;d me none but such toasts-and-butter, with hearts in their bellies no bigger than pins&#8217; heads, and they have bought out their services; and now my whole charge consists of ancients, corporals, lieutenants, gentlemen of companies&#8212;slaves as ragged as Lazarus in the painted cloth, where the glutton&#8217;s dogs lick&#8217;d his sores, and such as indeed were never soldiers, but discarded unjust servingmen, younger sons to younger brothers, revolted tapsters, and ostlers trade-fall&#8217;n, the cankers of a calm world and a long peace, ten times more dishonorable ragged than an old feaz&#8217;d ancient: and such have I, to fill up the rooms of them as have bought out their services, that you would think that I had a hundred and fifty totter&#8217;d prodigals lately come from swine-keeping, from eating draff and husks. A mad fellow met me on the way and told me I had unloaded all the gibbets and press&#8217;d the dead bodies. No eye hath seen such scarecrows. I&#8217;ll not march through Coventry with them, that&#8217;s flat. Nay, and the villains march wide betwixt the legs, as if they had gyves on, for indeed I had the most of them out of prison. There&#8217;s not a shirt and a half in all my company, and the half shirt is two napkins tack&#8217;d together and thrown over the shoulders like a herald&#8217;s coat without sleeves; and the shirt, to say the truth, stol&#8217;n from my host at Saint Albons, or the red-nose innkeeper of Daventry.

How if he should counterfeit too and rise? By my faith, I am afraid he would prove the better counterfeit. Therefore I&#8217;ll make him sure, yea, and I&#8217;ll swear I kill&#8217;d him.
