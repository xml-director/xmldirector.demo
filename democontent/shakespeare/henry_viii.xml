<line globalnumber="782" number="11">I&#8217;ll tell you in a little. The great Duke</line>
<line globalnumber="783" number="12">Came to the bar; where to his accusations</line>
<line globalnumber="784" number="13">He pleaded still not guilty, and alleged</line>
<line globalnumber="785" number="14">Many sharp reasons to defeat the law.</line>
<line globalnumber="786" number="15">The King&#8217;s attorney on the contrary</line>
<line globalnumber="787" number="16">Urg&#8217;d on the examinations, proofs, confessions</line>
<line globalnumber="788" number="17">Of divers witnesses, which the Duke desir&#8217;d</line>
<line globalnumber="789" number="18">To him brought <latin xml:lang="la">viv&#226; voce</latin> to his face;</line>
<line globalnumber="790" number="19">At which appear&#8217;d against him his surveyor,</line>
<line globalnumber="791" number="20">Sir Gilbert Perk his chancellor, and John Car,</line>

<line globalnumber="798" number="25">Would have flung from him; but indeed he could not.</line>
<line globalnumber="799" number="26">And so his peers upon this evidence</line>
<line globalnumber="800" number="27">Have found him guilty of high treason. Much</line>
<line globalnumber="801" number="28">He spoke, and learnedly, for life; but all</line>
<line globalnumber="802" number="29">Was either pitied in him or forgotten.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Second Gentleman">2. GENT.</speaker>
<line globalnumber="803" number="30">After all this, how did he bear himself?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="First Gentleman">1. GENT.</speaker>
<line globalnumber="804" number="31">When he was brought again to th&#8217; bar, to hear</line>
<line globalnumber="805" number="32">His knell rung out, his judgment, he was stirr&#8217;d</line>
<line globalnumber="806" number="33">With such an agony he sweat extremely,</line>
<line globalnumber="807" number="34">And something spoke in choler, ill, and hasty.</line>
<line globalnumber="808" number="35">But he fell to himself again, and sweetly</line>
<line globalnumber="809" number="36">In all the rest show&#8217;d a most noble patience.</line>
</speech>

<speaker long="Second Gentleman">2. GENT.</speaker>

<line globalnumber="900" number="117">That made me happy, at one stroke has taken</line>
<line globalnumber="901" number="118">Forever from the world. I had my trial,</line>
<line globalnumber="902" number="119">And must needs say a noble one; which makes me</line>

There is a fellow somewhat near the door, he should be a brazier by his face, for, o&#8217; my conscience, twenty of the dog-days now reign in &#8217;s nose; all that stand about him are under the line, they need no other penance: that fire-drake did I hit three times on the head, and three times was his nose discharg&#8217;d against me; he stands there like a mortar-piece to blow us. There was a haberdasher&#8217;s wife of small wit near him, that rail&#8217;d upon me till her pink&#8217;d porringer fell off her head, for kindling such a combustion in the state. I miss&#8217;d the meteor once, and hit that woman, who cried out &#8220;Clubs!&#8221; , when I might see from far some forty truncheoners draw to her succor, which were the hope o&#8217; th&#8217; Strond, where she was quarter&#8217;d. They fell on, I made good my place; at length they came to th&#8217; broom-staff to me, I defied &#8217;em still, when suddenly a file of boys behind &#8217;em, loose shot, deliver&#8217;d such a show&#8217;r of pibbles, that I was fain to draw mine honor in, and let &#8217;em win the work.
