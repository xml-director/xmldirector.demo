<line globalnumber="354" number="57">These late eclipses in the sun and moon portend no good to us. Though the wisdom of nature can reason it thus and thus, yet nature finds itself scourg&#8217;d by the sequent effects. Love cools, friendship falls off, brothers divide: in cities, mutinies; in countries, discord; in palaces, treason; and the bond crack&#8217;d &#8217;twixt son and father. This villain of mine comes under the prediction; 
there&#8217;s son against father: the King falls from bias of nature; there&#8217;s father against child. We have seen the best of our time. Machinations, hollowness, treachery, and all ruinous disorders follow us disquietly to our graves. Find out this villain, Edmund, it shall lose thee nothing, do it carefully. 
And the noble and true-hearted Kent banish&#8217;d! His offense, honesty! &#8217;Tis strange.</line>

An admirable evasion of whoremaster man, to lay his goatish disposition on the charge of a star! My father compounded with my mother under the Dragon&#8217;s tail, and my nativity was under Ursa Major, so that it follows, I am rough and lecherous.
