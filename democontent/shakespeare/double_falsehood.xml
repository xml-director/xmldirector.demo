What horsemanship has Julio? I think, he can no more but gallop a hackney, unless he practiced riding in france. It may be, he did so; for he was there a good continuance. But I have not heard him speak much of his horsemanship. That&#8217;s no matter: if he be not a good horseman, all&#8217;s one in such a case, he must bear.

My daughter, you must know, is such a tender soul, she cannot possibly see a Duke&#8217;s younger son without falling desperately in love with him. Now, you know, neighbor, when greatness rides post after a man of my years, &#8217;tis both prudence, and good breeding, to let one&#8217;s self be overtaken by it. And who can help all this?
