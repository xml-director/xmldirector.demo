<line globalnumber="1247" number="48">It was a mad fantastical trick of him to steal from the state, and usurp the beggary he was never born to. Lord Angelo dukes it well in his absence; he puts transgression to&#8217;t.</line>

<line globalnumber="1251" number="52">Yes, in good sooth, the vice is of a great kindred; it is well allied; but it is impossible to extirp it quite, friar, till eating and drinking be put down.

Farewell, good friar, I prithee pray for me. The Duke (I say to thee again) would eat mutton on Fridays.

Look, th&#8217; unfolding star calls up the shepherd. Put not yourself into amazement how these things should be; all difficulties are but easy when they are known. Call your executioner, and off with Barnardine&#8217;s head. I will give him a present shrift, and advise him for a better place. Yet you are amaz&#8217;d, but this shall absolutely resolve you.
