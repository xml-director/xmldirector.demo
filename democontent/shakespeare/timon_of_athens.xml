They were the most needless creatures living, should we ne&#8217;er have use for &#8217;em; and would most resemble sweet instruments hung up in cases, that keeps their sounds to themselves. Why, I have often wish&#8217;d myself poorer, that I might come nearer to you. We are born to do benefits; and what better or properer can we call our own than the riches of our friends?
