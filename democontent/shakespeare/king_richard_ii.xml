<line globalnumber="90" number="90">The which he hath detain&#8217;d for lewd employments,</line>

<line globalnumber="93" number="93">Or here or elsewhere to the furthest verge</line>
<line globalnumber="94" number="94">That ever was surveyed by English eye,</line>

<line globalnumber="97" number="97">Fetch from false Mowbray their first head and spring.</line>

<line globalnumber="99" number="99">Upon his bad life to make all this good,</line>
<line globalnumber="100" number="100">That he did plot the Duke of Gloucester&#8217;s death,</line>

<line globalnumber="102" number="102">And consequently, like a traitor coward,</line>
<line globalnumber="103" number="103">Sluic&#8217;d out his innocent soul through streams of blood,</line>

<line globalnumber="128" number="128">The other part reserv&#8217;d I by consent,</line>

<line globalnumber="130" number="130">Upon remainder of a dear account,</line>
<line globalnumber="131" number="131">Since last I went to France to fetch his queen.</line>
<line globalnumber="132" number="132">Now swallow down that lie. For Gloucester&#8217;s death,</line>
<line globalnumber="133" number="133">I slew him not, but to my own disgrace</line>
<line globalnumber="134" number="134">Neglected my sworn duty in that case.</line>
<line globalnumber="135" number="135">For you, my noble Lord of Lancaster,</line>
<line globalnumber="136" number="136">The honorable father to my foe,</line>
<line globalnumber="137" number="137">Once did I lay an ambush for your life,</line>
<line globalnumber="138" number="138">A trespass that doth vex my grieved soul;</line>
<line globalnumber="139" number="139">But ere I last receiv&#8217;d the sacrament</line>

<line globalnumber="141" number="141">Your Grace&#8217;s pardon, and I hope I had it.</line>
<line globalnumber="142" number="142">This is my fault. As for the rest appeal&#8217;d,</line>

<line globalnumber="147" number="147">Upon this overweening traitor&#8217;s foot,</line>

<line globalnumber="149" number="149">Even in the best blood chamber&#8217;d in his bosom,</line>

<line globalnumber="2636" number="8">A generation of still-breeding thoughts;</line>

<line globalnumber="2644" number="16">&#8220;It is as hard to come as for a camel</line>
<line globalnumber="2645" number="17">To thread the postern of a small needle&#8217;s eye.&#8221;</line>
<line globalnumber="2646" number="18">Thoughts tending to ambition, they do plot</line>

<line globalnumber="2651" number="23">Thoughts tending to content flatter themselves</line>
<line globalnumber="2652" number="24">That they are not the first of fortune&#8217;s slaves,</line>
<line globalnumber="2653" number="25">Nor shall not be the last&#8212;like seely beggars</line>
